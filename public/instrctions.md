‚úÖ TO-DO LIST for Resume Website (Next.js)

üñ•Ô∏è 1. Desktop Design Layout
Goal: Circular layout with central photo and surrounding navigation icons (as in your sketch)

Create a component <MainLayout> to render:

Central profile photo

Circular positioned items:

About Me

Contact Me

Instagram

Projects

Resume

Blog

LinkedIn

Use CSS Flexbox / Grid or absolute positioning with transforms for circular layout.

Use next/image for optimized image loading (profile photo and icons).

Apply hover interactions for navigation items (scale, tooltip, etc).

üì± 3. Mobile Design Layout
Goal: Stack the items vertically for readability.

Convert circular layout to vertical sections:

Top section: profile photo

Following: cards or list for:

About Me

Resume

Projects

Blog

Contact Me

Social Media (LinkedIn, Instagram)

Use responsive breakpoints with Tailwind CSS or CSS media queries (@media (max-width: 768px)).

üß± 4. Routing and Pages (Next.js File Routing)
Each item should route to a dedicated page.

pages/index.tsx ‚Üí Homepage (with circular layout)

pages/about.tsx ‚Üí About Me

pages/contact.tsx ‚Üí Contact

pages/projects.tsx ‚Üí Projects

pages/resume.tsx ‚Üí Resume PDF viewer/download

pages/blog.tsx ‚Üí Blog section

pages/api/contact.ts ‚Üí API route to handle contact form (optional)

External links (LinkedIn, Instagram) should open in a new tab

‚ö° 5. Performance Improvements (Next.js Best Practices)
Use dynamic imports for non-critical components like blog cards or project carousels.

Preload critical fonts via \_document.tsx.

Use Image from next/image for all image assets.

Add loading="lazy" where applicable.

Add getStaticProps() or getServerSideProps() if fetching dynamic data (like blog posts or projects).

Use next/head for setting proper meta tags for SEO and social previews.

Enable Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) if needed.

üß™ 6. Optional Enhancements
Add dark/light mode toggle.

Add animations using Framer Motion.

Use TailwindCSS

Add contact form with EmailJS or Nodemailer API.
